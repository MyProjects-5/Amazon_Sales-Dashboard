# Amazon Sales Dashboard
I am excited to share my tableau project on Amazon Sales Dashboard.

# Objective:-      
Thrilled to share a dynamic visualization showcasing sales and profit KPIs, breaking down insights category-wise, state-wise, region-wise, and diving into the nitty-gritty month-wise for each year.

# Key Features:-               
1) Sales and Profit KPIs at a glance.     
2) Drill down into categories for detailed analysis.       
3) Regional and state-wise performance breakdown.      
4) Monthly insights for each year.        
5) Seamless PDF download option for easy sharing and reporting.         

# conclusion:-
The analysis of the thesis indicates that it is possible to convert raw data into
meaningful information based on the analysis of the case study. From the
analysis, it was observed that applications such as Tableau provided a good
result in terms of creation of a dashboard. Microsoft Excel has less distinct
benefits as compared to Tableau.
